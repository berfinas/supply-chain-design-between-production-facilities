# supply-chain-design-between-production-facilities
senior year capstone project

worked on senior year capstone project "Supply Chain Design Between Production Facilities". designed a routing algorithm to be used in the transportation of intermediate products between different facilities and different regions. for this purpose, a greedy algorithm is implemented in Python. Using the PyQt5 library, a user-friendly and flexible user interface is designed. 

as a team of 7, we worked with a fastener manufacturer in this project, therefore, input data are not provided here due to confidentiality.
